## Description
This is a side project in React with a backend Rails API. Users authenticate
with a token and receive a confirmation email after signing up. Users can search
Beers, filter by type, sort by rating, ABV, and alphabetically. Users can also add
beers and rate beers. Beers that are added show up in the "My Beers" tab and only
appear in the global beers when their beer is approved by an admin. This is a work
in progress.

The project hosted on Heroku and is available [here.](https://beer-project0123.herokuapp.com/#)
